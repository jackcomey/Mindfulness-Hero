        <h2>8 Science-Backed Ways Mindfulness Helps us Heal and Thrive</h2>
        <h3>Burnout</h3>
        <p>
            A review of 23 studies looking at the effects of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) on employee burnout found that 8 weeks of mindfulness training reduced stress, psychological distress, depression, anxiety, emotional exhaustion and occupational stress, and increased self-compassion, relaxation, sleep quality, and a feeling of personal accomplishment.            
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Addiction</h3>
        <p>
            Mindfulness-based interventions may be helpful in decreasing craving and substance misuse according a review of several meta-analyses of 34 randomized controlled trials. Researchers suggest that mindfulness may be particularly effective in increasing a person’s awareness of stress, despair, anger, loneliness, and the cravings that can often trigger a relapse
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Suicide</h3>
        <p>
            An examination of a handful of available studies on the impacts of mindfulness-based interventions on suicidal behaviour found that mindfulness instruction may be particularly useful for helping individuals cope with stress and difficulties with problem-solving. It can also improve focused attention, and decrease suicidal thoughts; all known risk factors for suicide attempts.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Bias/harassment</h3>
        <p>
            A study of 72 college students revealed that mindfulness training can increase awareness of one’s underlying thoughts, and subsequently reduce negative attitudes and biases. In another study, students reported on their levels of mindfulness, self-esteem, and fear of being rejected in social situations. Those with low self-esteem were more afraid of rejection, however being more mindful decreased those effects.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Team dynamics</h3>
        <p>
            A study of 311 employees working at three Chinese companies looked at how individual and team mindfulness affected work engagement. Both individual and team mindfulness were linked to better employee recovery from work-related stress, and higher engagement with work tasks. What’s more, being immersed in work also positively impacted employee performance.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Worker and personal productivity</h3>
        <p>
            A review of 23 studies examining the benefits of mindfulness-based programs in the workplace found that following training, employees felt less stress, anxiety and psychological distress, and experienced greater overall well-being and sleep quality. Links between mindfulness training and other dimensions of work life, such as employee performance, leadership skill, and good decision-making were inconclusive.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Focus/attention</h3>
        <p>
            Scientists at Ohio State University reviewed 56 studies of the long-term effects of mindfulness instruction on attentional control. Training approaches ranged from retreats and feasibility studies, to randomized controlled trials. Retreat and feasibility studies showed increased goal-directed focus and attention to bodily sensations following a mindfulness program. Results from randomized controlled trials with an active control group; where participants received another form of instruction, were indecisive. (Not sure if this is satisfying in such a short form, but don’t want to give the impressions that RCTs align with the other findings). 
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Creativity/innovation</h3>
        <p>Mindfulness and creativity are significantly related according to researchers who reanalyzed 33 published articles with 1,549 participants. They concluded that mindfulness-based interventions focusing on open-monitoring may boost creative abilities. Exactly why and how mindfulness contributes to the creative process remains a mystery.</p>
