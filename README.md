# MINDFULNESS HERO
Mindfulness Hero is a website that helps to inspire people to mediate and be more mindful. The aim of the website is to provide information on the benefits associated with mindfulness & mediation with the end goal of having people signup.

## UX/UI
- Careful thought was put into this website to make it as attractive & as easy to navigate to the user as possible. 
- Roboto & Nunito is the font pairing used on the site. They have a simplicity to them and go quite well together. A wellness website should have simple fonts so they do not overwhelm the user. The combination was found on [fontpair](https://www.fontpair.co/all)
- I decided to go with teal as my main colour for the font & have it play a part in other elements of the website such as the icons and footer. This tone has been known to represent balance, calm, and soothing whilst also being restorative and rejuvenating â€“ perfect for any unsettled, uncertain times which users may be experiencing if seeking out a wellness website. 
- The landing page gives the user everything they need to know about the benefits mindfulness & mediation can give their lives. There is testimonials to how the website has helped other users as well as free content with articles and a meditation video. All of this should help in getting the user invested enough to sign up for more content and become part of the community. 

## Features

### Existing Features

    -  The navigation bar is at the very top of the page on the landing page as well as the article pages. It is identical on each page and allows for easy navigation.

## Credits

**Content**
- Navigation bar, hero image section and signup sections were inspired by the [Love Running](https://learn.codeinstitute.net/courses/course-v1:CodeInstitute+LR101+2021_T1/courseware/4a07c57382724cfda5834497317f24d5/f2db5fd401004fccb43b01a6066a5333/) project. Parts of the code were used again for this. 
- Reasons to be a hero, hero stories section and recent articles sections all have flex elements in it which required quite a bit of research outside of the course content to help the website be more responsive. The 2 videos used for this were from [Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u044iM9xsWU&t=1481s) and [Going-To Internet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVOmmc0UTiM)
